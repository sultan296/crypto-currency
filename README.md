# crypto-currency

In this project, I introduce a cryptocurrency website that I have created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site dynamically displays live prices for various cryptocurrencies, offering users a seamless experience in tracking current market values. With a clean design and user-friendly interface, the website not only displays the prices but also demonstrates the integration of real-time data in a visually appealing manner.
